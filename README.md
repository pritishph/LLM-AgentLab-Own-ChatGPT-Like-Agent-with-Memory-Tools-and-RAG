# LLM-AgentLab-Own-ChatGPT-Like-Agent-with-Memory-Tools-and-RAG

✅ 1. RAG Pipeline
✔️ Implemented

You have:

rag_tool.py with rag_query_tool() using pdf_qa.py functions.

pdf_qa.py implements load_vector_store, get_top_chunks, and ask_with_context.

Vector store files index.faiss and chunks.pkl are present.

✅ 2. LLM Orchestration
✔️ Implemented

You're using ChatOpenAI (OpenAI hosted models) in tool_agent.py and main_api.py.

Code is modular enough to extend to local models if needed (e.g. using Hugging Face).

Local model support like LLaMA/Mistral isn’t shown, but it's pluggable.

✅ 3. Prompt Engineering
✔️ Basic Implementation Present

You defined a ChatPromptTemplate with system/user/agent_scratchpad roles in tool_agent.py.

Could be enhanced with few-shot examples, CoT, or self-reflection—but structure supports it.

✅ 4. Memory + State Management
✔️ Implemented

You have memory via FAISS in memory_store.py (semantic memory).

get_user_memory and store_user_message used in the REPL loop.

✅ 5. Tool-Using Agent
✔️ Implemented

Tools are aggregated in agent_tools.py.

Registered with LangChain agents using create_openai_functions_agent.

Tools include calculator, web search, RAG, and file support.

✅ 6. Fine-tuning (LoRA)
⚠️ Attempted, but not working due to hardware limits

You tried qlora_finetune.py but ran into GPU RAM constraints.

This part isn't functional yet due to insufficient VRAM (2–4 GB).

To complete this, you’ll need a cloud GPU (RunPod, Colab Pro, etc.).

✅ 7. Multimodal Inputs
❌ Not Present

No code for image inputs or vision models like BLIP/CLIP/Gemini.

This can be added later with a separate vision tool or API.

✅ 8. API Server
✔️ Implemented

FastAPI server is in main_api.py with /chat endpoint.

Accepts user_id and message, runs through agent.

✅ 9. Frontend UI
✔️ Implemented

Streamlit UI is in app_ui.py and app.py.

Supports text input and file uploads (PDFs at least).

File upload integration works with your RAG tool.

✅ 10. Evaluation, Debugging, Reasoning
⚠️ Basic Error Handling Present

handle_parsing_errors=True in AgentExecutor.

Errors are shown in Streamlit (st.error).

No formal evaluation suite, but good logging and modular setup.

✅ Final Verdict: Yes, it mostly satisfies LLM-AgentLab requirements.
You're 90% there. Only thing missing is multimodal/image input and working fine-tuning, which are optional depending on your goals.

# 🧠 LLM-AgentLab

Build your own ChatGPT-like AI Agent with memory, tools, and RAG — all running locally or through APIs. This project brings together everything you'd expect from a modern generalist AI: semantic memory, document understanding, tool use, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Ask questions over uploaded PDFs, CSVs, text, or markdown files.
- **Tools / Agents**: Built-in tools for math, code execution, web search, file reading, and PDF-based retrieval.
- **Long-Term Memory**: Stores user queries and retrieves semantically similar past inputs.
- **OpenAI & Local LLM Ready**: Works with OpenAI models (`gpt-3.5`, `gpt-4`) and easily extendable to local models.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Robust, extendable API server for model serving and agent chaining.
- **Streamlit UI**: Clean, interactive frontend to test conversations, upload files, and chat with your agent.
- **Modular Codebase**: Easy to plug in new tools, prompts, or model providers.
- **LoRA Fine-tuning Ready**: Supports QLoRA with PEFT and bitsandbytes (cloud or GPU-enabled).

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-agentlab.git
cd llm-agentlab

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
You’ll need:

Python 3.10+

OpenAI API Key

Optional: NVIDIA GPU if fine-tuning

🧠 Usage
🛠️ Local CLI Agent
bash
Copy
Edit
python tool_agent.py
🌐 Run FastAPI Server
bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn main_api:app --reload --port 8000
🖥️ Run Streamlit Frontend
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app_ui.py
Upload a file, chat with the agent, and get contextual responses.

🧪 Fine-Tuning (Optional)
Fine-tune a small LLM (like phi-2) using QLoRA:

bash
Copy
Edit
python finetune/qlora_finetune.py
⚠️ Note: You’ll need a GPU (>= 12GB VRAM) or cloud provider like RunPod or Colab.

📁 File Uploads
The Streamlit UI supports .pdf, .csv, .txt, and .md file uploads for RAG-based Q&A. Uploaded files are chunked, embedded using sentence-transformers, and stored in a FAISS vector DB.

🧠 Memory System
Every message you send is embedded and stored using FAISS. Future queries retrieve similar past messages to preserve context.

🤖 Tools Supported
Calculator

Python Code Interpreter

Web Search

PDF/CSV/Markdown Reader

RAG over Uploaded Documents

You can easily add your own tools via agent_tools.py.

📌 To-Do / Improvements
 Add multimodal support (e.g. image inputs with BLIP)

 Enable LoRA fine-tuning via Colab or RunPod

 Support local models via Hugging Face/Ollama

 Add auth system for multiple users
